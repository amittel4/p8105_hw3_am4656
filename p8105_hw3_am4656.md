# Problem 1

-   The instacart dataset includes **1384617 rows** and **15 columns**.
-   There are **131209 distinct users** who have ordered a total of
    **1384617 orders** among **39123 distinct products**.
-   Key variables include: order_id, product_id, user_id, order_number,
    order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_orer, aisle_id, and
    department_id.
-   There are **134 aisles**.
-   In Table 1 below we can see that the most items are ordered from
    Aisle 83, with a total of 150,609 items ordered.

| aisle_id |      n |
|---------:|-------:|
|       83 | 150609 |
|       24 | 150473 |
|      123 |  78493 |
|      120 |  55240 |

**Table 1**

-   Plot indicating number of items in each aisle:

-   Table 2, below, shows the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”, including the number of times each item is
    ordered.

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |

| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |

| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

**Table 2**

-   Table 3, below, shows the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week,
    formatted for human readers (i.e. a 2 x 7 table).

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

**Table 3**

## Problem 2

After loading and cleaning the accel_data file, the resultant dataset
has **50400 rows** and **6** columns. The dataset is organized such that
accelerometer data (`activity_count`) is listed for 35 days by day of
week, weekend day status, and chronological minute of day.

| day_id | weekend | total_activity_count |

The mean activity count over the observed period is 267.0440592. It
looks like there may be more substantial variation in activity between
weekend days versus non weekend days. Some weekends appear to have very
low activity while others have high activity.

Figure 1 below shows 24-hour accelerometer data over the course of each
day of the week.

``` r
accel_data %>%
  mutate(day = forcats::fct_relevel(day, c("Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = (minute_of_day/60), y = activity_count, color = day)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure 1. Activity Count by Hour of Day",
    x = "Hour of Day",
    y = "Activity Count",
    caption = "35 day observation"
  ) +
 theme_minimal()
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

From this figure, we can see that the patient’s activity tends to
increase after 5 a.m. and stay moderately high until about 8 p.m., when
it then sharply drops off. On Fridays, there is a large amount of
activity late in the evening from approximately 8 - 10 p.m. On Sundays
there is a large amount of activity mid-day, from approximately 10
a.m. - 12 p.m.
